### Data Integration Process

#### Step 1: Update Book Data Files
For each book with audiobook, update the TypeScript file:

```typescript
// Example: crime-and-punishment.ts
export const crimeAndPunishmentNovel: Book = {
  // ... existing properties
  
  // Enable audiobook features
  hasAudio: true,
  isAudiobook: true,
  audioUrl: '/audio/books/crime-and-punishment-dostoevsky/en/full.mp3',
  audioDuration: 72000, // 20 hours in seconds
  narrator: 'LibriVox Community',
  audioQuality: 'high',
  
  // Chapter-based audio files
  audioChapters: [
    {
      id: 'part-1-chapter-1',
      title: 'Part I - Chapter I',
      audioUrl: '/audio/books/crime-and-punishment-dostoevsky/en/part-1-chapter-1.mp3',
      duration: 2400, // 40 minutes
      startTime: 0
    },
    // ... all chapters
  ]
};
```
