  explanation: "Blake's famous poem explores the psychological concept of integrating both light and dark aspects of existence. The 'Tyger' represents the fierce, potentially destructive forces within the psyche that must be acknowledged and integrated for psychological wholeness. The question 'Did he who made the Lamb make thee?' addresses the psychological challenge of accepting that creation includes both gentle and fierce aspects. This poem speaks to the recovery process of accepting all parts of oneself, including the 'fearful' aspects, as necessary for psychological integration and mental health.",
