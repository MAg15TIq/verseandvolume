    "No, no, go not to Lethe, neither twist",
    "Wolf's-bane, tight-rooted, for its poisonous wine;",
    "Nor suffer thy pale forehead to be kiss'd",
    "By nightshade, ruby grape of Proserpine;",
    "Make not your rosary of yew-berries,",
    "Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be",
    "Your mournful Psyche, nor the downy owl",
    "A partner in your sorrow's mysteries;",
    "For shade to shade will come too drowsily,",
    "And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.",
    "",
    "But when the melancholy fit shall fall",
    "Sudden from heaven like a weeping cloud,",
    "That fosters the droop-headed flowers all,",
    "And hides the green hill in an April shroud;",
    "Then glut thy sorrow on a morning rose,",
    "Or on the rainbow of the salt sand-wave,",
    "Or on the wealth of globed peonies;",
    "Or if thy mistress some rich anger shows,",
    "Emprison her soft hand, and let her rave,",
    "And feed deep, deep upon her peerless eyes."

  explanation: "Keats's ode offers a sophisticated approach to dealing with depression and melancholy. Rather than seeking escape through self-destruction (the poisonous plants mentioned), the poem advocates for fully experiencing melancholy while finding beauty within it. This approach aligns with modern therapeutic concepts of acceptance and mindfulness. The poem suggests that trying to numb or escape depression ('shade to shade') only 'drowns the wakeful anguish,' while engaging with beauty during dark periods can provide a healthier way to process difficult emotions.",
