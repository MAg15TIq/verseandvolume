The repetitive use of 'Remember' creates a meditative, therapeutic rhythm that helps process trauma through reconnection with ancestral wisdom, nature, and universal belonging. The poem addresses intergenerational trauma while providing a path to healing through spiritual and psychological reconnection. It demonstrates how remembering one's place in the larger web of existence can be profoundly healing for psychological wounds.",
