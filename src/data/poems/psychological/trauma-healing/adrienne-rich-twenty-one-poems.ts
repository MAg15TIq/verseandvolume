  explanation: "This excerpt from Rich's groundbreaking lesbian love poem sequence explores the psychological trauma of living in a hostile society while trying to maintain authentic relationships. The repetitive imagery of carrying children (dead and alive) represents the psychological burden of trauma and hope. The final lines about the 'oppressor's language' capture the psychological complexity of using the very systems that oppress you to express love and truth. The poem addresses how trauma affects intimate relationships and the healing power of authentic connection.",
