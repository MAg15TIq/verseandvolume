    "I stand on top",
    "of our back steps and breathe the rich air—",
    "a mother skunk with her column of kittens swills the garbage pail.",

  explanation: "This confessional poem captures Lowell's experience with bipolar disorder and mental breakdown. The famous line 'My mind's not right' directly addresses mental illness, while 'I myself am hell' echoes Milton and expresses the internal torment of depression. The voyeuristic behavior and feelings of isolation reflect psychological disturbance. The skunks at the end represent resilience and survival instinct, contrasting with the speaker's mental fragility. This poem is considered a masterpiece of confessional poetry.",
