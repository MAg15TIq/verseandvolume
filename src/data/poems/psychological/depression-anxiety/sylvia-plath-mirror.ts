    "The eye of a little god, four-cornered.",
    "Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.",
    "It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long",

    "Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,",
    "Searching my reaches for what she really is.",
    "Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.",
    "I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.",
    "She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.",
    "I am important to her. She comes and goes.",

    "In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman",
    "Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish."

  explanation: "This poem explores themes of self-perception, aging, and the psychological impact of confronting one's true self. The mirror serves as a metaphor for honest self-reflection, while the woman's search for her 'real' self represents the human struggle with identity and self-acceptance. The transformation from mirror to lake suggests the depth of self-examination, and the final image of the 'terrible fish' rising represents the fear of aging and mortality. The poem captures the psychological anxiety surrounding self-image and the passage of time.",
