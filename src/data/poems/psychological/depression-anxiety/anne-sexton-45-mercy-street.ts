  explanation: "This deeply personal poem explores themes of mental illness, family trauma, and the search for healing and redemption. The 'Mercy Street' represents a place of safety and belonging that the speaker desperately seeks but cannot find. The repetitive searching and the final line 'I reside in hell' capture the experience of depression and psychological suffering. Sexton's confessional style reveals the raw emotional reality of mental illness and the longing for mercy and peace.",
