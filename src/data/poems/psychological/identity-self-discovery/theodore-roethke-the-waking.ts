  explanation: "This villanelle explores the psychological journey of self-discovery and acceptance of life's uncertainties. The paradoxical opening line 'I wake to sleep' suggests the cyclical nature of consciousness and unconsciousness, both literal and metaphorical. The poem captures the psychological process of learning through experience rather than rational thought, emphasizing intuitive knowledge and emotional understanding. Roethke's exploration of 'thinking by feeling' reflects a psychological approach to understanding oneself and the world.",
