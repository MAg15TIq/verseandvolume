  explanation: "This excerpt from Rich's famous poem uses the metaphor of deep-sea diving to explore psychological self-discovery and the journey into one's unconscious mind. The 'wreck' represents both personal and collective trauma that must be explored and understood. The solitary nature of the dive emphasizes the individual psychological work required for self-discovery. The poem captures the courage needed to confront difficult truths about oneself and society, making it a powerful exploration of psychological archaeology and identity formation.",
