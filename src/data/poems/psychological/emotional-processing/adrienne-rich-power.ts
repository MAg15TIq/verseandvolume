  explanation: "This powerful poem explores the psychological complexity of power, achievement, and self-destruction. Rich uses Marie Curie as a metaphor for how the sources of our strength can also be the sources of our wounds. The poem addresses the psychological tendency to deny the harmful effects of what gives us power or identity. It speaks to the emotional processing required to acknowledge that our greatest strengths and our deepest wounds often come from the same source, a profound psychological insight about human nature and the cost of achievement.",
