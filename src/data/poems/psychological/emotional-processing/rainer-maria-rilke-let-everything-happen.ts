  explanation: "This brief but profound poem by Rilke offers essential wisdom for emotional processing and psychological resilience. The instruction to 'let everything happen' encourages acceptance of all emotions rather than resistance, which is a key principle in modern therapy. The reminder that 'no feeling is final' provides hope during difficult emotional states and encourages patience with the natural flow of emotions. The poem serves as a guide for healthy emotional processing, suggesting that both beauty and terror are necessary parts of the human experience.",
