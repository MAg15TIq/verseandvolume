  explanation: "This poem explores the psychological nature of truth and perception, suggesting that direct confrontation with reality can be psychologically overwhelming. The metaphor of lightning represents how sudden truth can be blinding or traumatic, while 'telling it slant' suggests the need for gradual psychological processing. Dickinson's insight into how the mind processes difficult truths reflects deep understanding of psychological defense mechanisms and the need for gentle revelation in therapy and self-discovery.",
