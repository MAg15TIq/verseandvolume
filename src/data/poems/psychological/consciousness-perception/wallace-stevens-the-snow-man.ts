    "One must have a mind of winter",
    "To regard the frost and the boughs",
    "Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;",
    "",
    "And have been cold a long time",
    "To behold the junipers shagged with ice,",
    "The spruces rough in the distant glitter",
    "",
    "Of the January sun; and not to think",
    "Of any misery in the sound of the wind,",
    "In the sound of a few leaves,",
    "",
    "Which is the sound of the land",
    "Full of the same wind",
    "That is blowing in the same bare place",
    "",
    "For the listener, who listens in the snow,",
    "And, nothing himself, beholds",
    "Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is."

  explanation: "Stevens's poem explores the psychological concept of pure perception - seeing reality without the overlay of human emotion or interpretation. The 'mind of winter' represents a state of consciousness that can observe without projecting meaning or feeling onto what is observed. The final line about beholding 'nothing that is not there and the nothing that is' captures the psychological challenge of seeing reality as it actually is, without the additions of our mental constructs. This relates to mindfulness practices and the psychological work of distinguishing between perception and interpretation.",
