    explanation: "This is the prologue to Akhmatova's masterpiece 'Requiem', a cycle of poems written between 1935 and 1940 during the Stalinist terror. The poem documents the suffering of the Russian people under Soviet terror, particularly the women who waited outside prison walls hoping for news of their arrested family members. Akhmatova's own son was arrested, and she waited in prison lines for information about him. The poem was too dangerous to write down during Stalin's reign, so Akhmatova and her friends memorized it by heart, and it was not published in Russia until 1987.",
