    "In the quiet moments between dawn and day,",

    "I hear the whispers of my heart,",
    "Speaking truths that set me apart.",
    "",
    "Like pages turning in an ancient book,",
    "Each word a journey, each line a look",
    "Into the depths of human soul,",
    "Where love and longing make us whole.",

    "The heart speaks not in words alone,",
    "But in rhythms that have always known",
    "The language of the universe,",
    "In verses both simple and diverse.",

    "Of hope that in darkness abounds,",
    "Of courage found in tender places,",
    "And grace that time never erases.",

    "For every heart has its own song,",
    "A melody that carries on",

    "So let your heart speak freely now,",
    "And to its wisdom learn to bow,",
    "For in its whispers, pure and clear,",
    "You'll find the voice you need to hear."
