    "Storm has set the heavens scowling,",
    "Whirling gusty blizzards wild,",
    "Now they are like beasts a-growling,",
    "Now a-wailing like a child;",
    "Now along the brittle thatches,",
    "They will scud with rustling sound;",
    "Now against the window latches",
    "Like belated wanderers pound.",
    "",
    "Our frail hut is glum and sullen,",
    "Dim with twilight and with care.",
    "Why, dear granny, have you fallen",
    "Silent by the window there?",
    "Has the gale's insistent prodding",
    "Made your drowsy head decline?",
    "Or the wheel's monotonous plodding",
    "Lulled you with its humming whine?",
    "",
    "Let us drink for grief, let's drown it,",
    "Comrade of my wretched youth;",
    "Where's the wine-cup? We will crown it!",
    "Wine will make us less uncouth.",
    "Sing me of the tomtit hatching",
    "Safe beyond the ocean foam,",
    "Sing about the maiden fetching",
    "Water at the morning's gloam.",
    "",
    "Tell me tales of distant summers,",
    "When the fields were green and bright,",
    "When the village bells were humming",
    "Songs of joy from morn till night.",
    "Speak of lovers in the meadow,",
    "Dancing underneath the stars,",
    "Far from winter's icy shadow,",
    "Free from sorrow's bitter scars.",
    "",
    "For the storm outside grows stronger,",
    "And the night grows dark and deep,",
    "But with stories we'll grow longer",
    "In our hearts the warmth we'll keep.",
    "Though the wind may howl and bluster,",
    "Though the snow may block our door,",
    "In our souls we'll always muster",
    "Light to last forevermore."

  explanation: "This poem by Pushkin captures the stark beauty of a Russian winter evening. It begins with vivid descriptions of a winter storm, then shifts to a cozy interior scene with the narrator and his elderly companion. The poem ends with a call for wine and songs to lift their spirits against the harsh weather outside, showing Pushkin's characteristic blend of natural imagery and human warmth. The extended version develops themes of companionship, memory, and the power of storytelling to provide comfort during difficult times.",
