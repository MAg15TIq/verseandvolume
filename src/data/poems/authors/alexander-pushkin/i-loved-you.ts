  explanation: "This is one of Pushkin's most famous love poems, expressing the selfless nature of true love. The poet wishes happiness for his former lover even as he acknowledges his own lingering feelings. The original Russian version is known for its musicality and emotional restraint. This extended version explores the depth of selfless love and the nobility of wishing happiness for someone even when it means personal sacrifice. The poem exemplifies the highest form of love - one that seeks the beloved's happiness above all else.",
