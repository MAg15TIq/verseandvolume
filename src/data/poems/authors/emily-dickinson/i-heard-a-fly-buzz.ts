  explanation: "This poem presents death from the perspective of someone who has already died, looking back at the moment of death. The fly represents the mundane reality that intrudes upon the expected grandeur of death, suggesting that death may be more ordinary than we imagine. The extended version explores the contrast between expectations of a dramatic, spiritual death and the reality of life's simple, persistent presence even in death's moment. Dickinson's genius lies in finding profound meaning in the most ordinary interruption.",
