  explanation: "In this poem, Dickinson metaphorically describes hope as a bird ('the thing with feathers') that lives within the human soul and sings continuously, even in the face of the strongest storms. The bird of hope never asks for anything in return, suggesting that hope is both resilient and freely given. The poem is one of Dickinson's most famous and beloved works for its uplifting message. This extended version includes additional stanzas that further develop the metaphor of hope as an enduring, selfless companion through life's difficulties.",
